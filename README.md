### CLUSTERING MACHINE LEARNING

Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."

It does it by finding some similar patterns in the unlabelled dataset such as shape, size, color, behavior, etc., and divides them as per the presence and absence of those similar patterns.

It is an unsupervised learning method, hence no supervision is provided to the algorithm, and it deals with the unlabeled dataset.

After applying this clustering technique, each cluster or group is provided with a cluster-ID. ML system can use this id to simplify the processing of large and complex datasets.

The clustering technique is commonly used for statistical data analysis.

### Clustering is somewhere similar to the classification algorithm, but the difference is the type of dataset that we are using. In classification, we work with the labeled data set, whereas in clustering, we work with the unlabelled dataset.

### The clustering technique can be widely used in various tasks. Some most common uses of this technique are:

Market Segmentation
Statistical data analysis
Social network analysis
Image segmentation
Anomaly detection, etc.

Apart from these general usages, it is used by the Amazon in its recommendation system to provide the recommendations as per the past search of products. Netflix also uses this technique to recommend the movies and web-series to its users as per the watch history.

### Types of Clustering Methods

The clustering methods are broadly divided into Hard clustering (datapoint belongs to only one group) and Soft Clustering (data points can belong to another group also). But there are also other various approaches of Clustering exist. Below are the main clustering methods used in Machine learning:

Partitioning Clustering

Density-Based Clustering

Distribution Model-Based Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

Fuzzy Clustering
